# Analyzing the impact of internet usage on depression and anxiety with Python

This study examines the impact of internet and social media usage on the global prevalence of depression and anxiety by exploring whether the adoption of internet technology correlates with higher rates of reported depression. Using public datasets from The Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation (IHME) and Our World in Data (OWID), the analysis employs Python tools like Pandas and NumPy for exploratory data analysis, SciPy-Stats for regression modeling, and MatPlotLib for visualization. 

Findings reveal a minimally negative correlation between the average global time spent on social media and anxiety prevalence, but a minimally positive correlation with depression. For internet usage, there is a weak positive correlation with depression among youths less than 20 years of age.

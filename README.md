This project examines the impact of internet and social media usage on the global prevalence of reported depression and anxiety. Using public datasets from The Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation (IHME) and Our World in Data (OWID), the analysis employs Python tools like Pandas and NumPy for exploratory data analysis, SciPy-Stats for regression modeling, and MatPlotLib for visualization.

Findings reveal a minimally negative correlation between the average global time spent on social media and anxiety prevalence, but a minimally positive correlation with depression for those less than 20 years of age. For internet usage, there is a weak positive correlation with depression among youths less than 20 years of age.
